# What is Machine Learning?

One of our goals in this lesson is to help you get a clearer, more specific understanding of what machine learning is and how it differs from other approaches.

Let's start with a classic definition. If you look up the term in a search engine, you might find something like this:

---

> Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and forecast future outcomes, behaviors, and trends.

Let's break that down a little. One important component of machine learning is that we are taking some data and using it to make predictions or identify important relationships. But looking for patterns in data is done in traditional data science as well. So how does machine learning differ? In this next video, we'll go over a few examples to illustrate the difference between machine learning and traditional programming.
